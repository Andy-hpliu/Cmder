# Cmder
<!-- ![Butler](/Data/butler.png) -->

A fork of the awesome [Cmder](https://github.com/bliker/cmder/) project.

Was customizing it for myself, thought I'd just share it.

I've added "msysgit", "gow", "putty" for myself. They are in the vendor folder. You can place other 3rd party stuff in the same folder.

See the ".gitignore" file for the entire structure.
